Algorithm: Postfix to value
P = Postfix Expression Vector 
Value = Result

1.	add ")" at the final P as centinela
2.	Scan P until find ")"
	3.	If is an operand, push to Stack
	4.	If is an operator:
		a)	B=pop from Stack, A=pop from Stack
		b)	C = A operator B
		c)	push(C) to Stack
5.	Value = pop from  Stack
