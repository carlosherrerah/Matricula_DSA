Algorithm Infix to Postfix 
Polish chains.(Q = Infix Expression Vector, P = Postfix Expression Vector).

1.	Put "(" at the beginning of expression Q and 
	Put ")" at the end of expression Q
2. 	Scan Q from left to right and repeat step 3 to 6 for each element of Q
	3. If an operand is encountered add it to P
	4. If is "(" push it onto STACK
	5. If an operator is encountered then:
		a.	Repeatedly pop from the STACK and add to P each operator (on top of STACK) 
			which has same or higher precedence than the operator.
		b. 	Add operator to STACK
	6. If ")" is encountered then
		a. 	Repeatedly pop from the STACK and add to P each operator (on top of stack)
			until a "(" is encountered
		b. 	pop from STACK the left parenthesis. Do not add to P.
7. Print P
